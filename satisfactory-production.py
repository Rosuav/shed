Ways to get Fuel
- "Diluted Fuel" Blender 5 Residue + 10 Water/6s = 10
  - <Heavy Oil Rubber> * 125%
  - Net: 3.75 Crude + 12.5 Water/6s = 10 Fuel + 1.25 Rubber; Refinery*125% + Refinery*62.5% + Blender
- "Diluted Packaged Fuel" 1 Residue + 2 Water/2s = 2, also needs 2xPackager at same clock speed
  - <Heavy Oil Rubber> * 75%
  - Net: 2.25 Crude + 7.5 Water/6s = 6 Fuel + 0.75 Rubber; Refinery*75% + Refinery*37.5% + Refinery + Packager + Packager
- "Residual Fuel" 6 Residue/6s = 4
  - "Rubber" * 3
  - Net: 9 Crude/6s = 4 Fuel + 6 Rubber; Refinery*300% + Refinery
- "Fuel" 6 Crude/6s = 4 + 3 Resin
  - "Residual Rubber" * 50%
  - Net: 6 Crude + 3 Water/6s = 4 Fuel + 3 Rubber; Refinery + Refinery * 50%

The only ways to get Resin are from Crude, and the only ways to use it involve Water.

Get Residue
- "Rubber" 3 Crude/6s = 2 Residue + 2 Rubber
- <Heavy Oil Rubber> 3 Crude + 2 Water/6s = 4 Residue + 1 Rubber; Refinery "Heavy Oil Residue" + Refinery "Residual Rubber" * 50%
