7015: The Dragon's Umbra
========================

Seventy-Fifteen, Kurgstown. The challenge is survival. And loot, of course;
have to have loot. But mainly survival. Every day you live is another day's
adventure, another day's risk, and another day's funerals, for the ones who
didn't make it. You've managed to reach adulthood, which probably puts your
own lifespan into the 75th percentile; but now your training really begins,
with magical and mundane life-and-death survival techniques. Good luck.

Despite the constant risks, you feel pretty good about your chances in life
right now; after all, you got this far, right? You even have a few friends,
and friends not only help your survival, they make looting oh! so much more
gratifying. That fancy staff? Give it to the wizard. Ooh, full plate armor,
only one way to find out if it's cursed or not! Some day, perhaps, you hope
not too soon, it'll be time to face the Dragon, and you want to be ready...


Character creation
------------------

Your first character starts at level 1. Use "roll stats" once and distribute
the scores as you please. Yes, this means you're not as powerful as you might
be, and there's going to be some variation in the scores. I know.

When (not if!) your first character dies, you may create a new character with
half as many levels, rounded up. So if your character dies at level 7, you
start a new one (of the same class or different) and immediately level to 4.


Time and date
-------------

Unsurprisingly, it's the year 7015 of the current calendar. Months, weeks,
and days are not named; time is simply counted in years since the dragon
ascended to power. Within each year, days are numbered sequentially, with
no intermediate divisions. Our story begins on Day 73 of this year; each
session will generally advance time by one day, and time usually will not
pass between sessions.


Gear
----

There are no permanent shops with regular inventory. Anyone who tried to
run one would probably die poor, but people who adventure die rich. There
is, however, an extensive and highly liquid market for weapons and armor of
all types; in fact, you might even say that the value of the gold piece is
defined in terms of weapons, rather than the other way around. All mundane
and masterwork weapons and armor (including shields) can be purchased at DMG
prices, and can be sold for the same (not halved). Basic enchantments on
non-exotic weapons are also readily available. Everything else is probably
available too, but subject to a DM's percentile roll, the goal for which
depends on the level of enchantment and the specificity thereof (it's easier
to get "any elemental enchantment" than "flaming burst"). Availability rolls
may be retried daily.

Due to the near-perfect liquidity of weapons and armor, none will be given
in loot - it's assumed that you sell them and get what you need. Consumables
(potions/oils/scrolls/wands/staves) and rods/rings/wondrous items are far
less available on the market, but can be found in loot.

In lieu of the regular starting package, players start with one +1 weapon of
any design. If starting above level 1, the item is enchanted to that level or
equivalent. Mundane goods listed in the PHB for less than 10gp are presumed
to be available at no cost, as long as you don't mind that they were ripped
off somebody's corpse a few days ago, and will probably get ripped off yours
before long. (NOTE: This does not apply to services, since it's hard to rip
a day's use of a hireling off somebody's corpse.)


Combat
------

Every day, and sometimes more than once a day, you'll be faced with a combat
challenge. Battles against these 'Umbrals' is every bit as tough as battles
against more solid foes would be, plus they're impossible to bluff or feint.
All umbrals are mythical beings, completely fictional, and any resemblance
to real person, alive or dead, is purely coincidental. Especially, they are
most definitely NOT the ghosts of the deceased, and I have no idea why you
would think that they might be. Anyway, they have nice loot, so if you can
survive the battle, you'll be better off. Strangely, the battles seem to be
always just a bit harder than you'd normally be able to manage - not enough
to be overwhelming, but just hard enough that you're tempted to stay and
fight, and probably die.

Expect to die and reroll at least once. No punches will be pulled. When you
are dead, you are probably dead-dead, unless someone in the party has a
Raise Dead spell; NPC spellcasters are not generally available.


Winning the game
----------------

At any time, you can challenge the dragon itself. The fight will be the party
against the dragon, to the death. There is no retreating. Planar travel is
prevented. If you fail, you ALL will die.

After every victory against an Umbral, you earn the right to ask one simple
question about the dragon. It must be something that can be explained IC, so
you can't ask its CR, but can ask about its age category (for instance).
Answers are guaranteed to be truthful and accurate, but may be limited to what
is known to a minor deity - since that's effectively what you're inquiring of.
You may retain this information across death, and share it among the party.
The question must be one of simple fact - you cannot request advice, for
instance - and one victory entitles you to just one simple answer, not a whole
book. Beyond that, it's basically up to you.
