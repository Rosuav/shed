Thinkful Workshop across Twitch and Owl
=======================================

Everyone is welcome to attend the public part of the workshop on [twitch.tv/rosuav](https://twitch.tv/rosuav). Thinkful students and faculty are able to also join the Owl session, the URL for which is available on the workshop listings (and varies from week to week).

Text chat is available on both platforms. To ask questions by voice, you must be using Owl. Please note that there is a latency difference between the platforms - don't be surprised if it takes me several seconds to start responding.
