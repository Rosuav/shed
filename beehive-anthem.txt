Magnificent... Oh, oh, magnificent
I was born, I was born to be with you
In this space and time
After that and ever after I haven't had a clue
Only to regret(?)
This foolishness can leave a heart black and blue
Only love, only love can leave such a mark
Only love, only love can heal such a scar

I was born, I was born to sing for you
I didn't have a choice but to lift you up
And sing whatever song you wanted me to
I give you back my voice from the womb
My first cry, it was a joyful noise
Only love, only love can leave such a mark
Only love, only love can heal such a scar

Justified till we die, you and I will magnify
Magnificent, Magnificent, ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

.... This is your solo, Beehive... take it away! .....

Only love, only love can leave such a mark
Only love, only love unites our hearts

Justified till we die, you and I will magnify
Magnificent.... Magnificent!
Magnificent.
