After a long and hard day of painting in the woods, the artist finally flipped
out. Those evil ducks! They had to pay. It was time. Time to destroy every last
duck, every last trace of duckdom from this planet. Starting... right here.

DeviCat

This feline terror has many victims to her name already. Some of them bled, some
did not. The gigantic 'X' on the head is one of her signatures, her calling-cards,
and she is not afraid to sign in blood.

DeviCat
-------

In order to create her amazing characters, the Devi must first acquire the
critical components. As we all know, the eyes are the window to the soul, and
the Devi seeks to use only the most excellent windows, taken one or two eyes
at a time from her various victims. Sometimes, she is able to take an entire
face from one character and transplant it onto another, improving construction
efficiency dramatically.

Plain and simple. You can draw a gun, you can draw a sword, and you can even
draw feet, just as long as you don't violate the Twitch Terms of Service.

DeviCat
-------

To get enough components (see above), the Devi needs an unending supply of
victims. Despite easily having enough for her current harvesting needs, she
gleefully seeks more, more, ever more.

Beware the cute ones. Despite her theme being all pastel pinks and blues,
this deadly woman is the reason for all those misshapen heads you have seen.
Here she sketches one of the tools she uses for altering head shapes.
