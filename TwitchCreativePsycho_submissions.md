The Twitch Creative Psychos
===========================

_Disclaimer: The write-ups here are non-authoritative and probably false. But
that never stopped anyone._

MissCoookiez
------------

After a long and hard day of painting in the woods, the artist finally flipped
out. Those evil ducks! They had to pay. It was time. Time to destroy every last
duck, every last trace of duckdom from this planet. Starting... right here.

DeviCat
-------

This feline terror has many victims to her name already. Some of them bled, some
did not. The gigantic 'X' on the head is one of her signatures, her calling-cards,
and she is not afraid to sign in blood.

DeviCat
-------

In order to create her amazing characters, the Devi must first acquire the
critical components. As we all know, the eyes are the window to the soul, and
the Devi seeks to use only the most excellent windows, taken one or two eyes
at a time from her various victims. Sometimes, she is able to take an entire
face from one character and transplant it onto another, improving construction
efficiency dramatically.

SleepyMia
---------

Plain and simple. You can draw a gun, you can draw a sword, and you can even
draw feet, just as long as you don't violate the Twitch Terms of Service.

DeviCat
-------

To get enough components (see above), the Devi needs an unending supply of
victims. Despite easily having enough for her current harvesting needs, she
gleefully seeks more, more, ever more.

CandySprout
-----------

Beware the cute ones. Despite her theme being all pastel pinks and blues,
this deadly woman is the reason for all those misshapen heads you have seen.
Here she sketches one of the tools she uses for altering head shapes.

DeviCat
-------

Not all her body parts are personally harvested. Here we see the Devi opening
a box of mail-order components; they were blind-boxed, and she did not know
exactly which parts would be included. It surprised her greatly to find that
one of them was... a tooth.

FierceKittenz
-------------

Like the Devi, this kitten is not afraid to get her hands dirty, obtaining
victims and dissecting them for usable components. Here she contemplates her
options, cautioning the viewers that the dissection process can at times be
noisy (for obvious reasons).

ProphTart
---------

Beware those who create things without properly thinking about their layers.
This poor gentleman cannot be blamed for his actions, as it is not his fault
that a demon took possession of his body. Note the background of Lucia di
Lammermoor, subtly hinting at the likely fate of this man's wife.

DeviCat
-------

Here we see the steps just prior to dissection. The Devi seeks out a new body,
but since that body is currently fully operational, she must select a method of
de-operationalizing the body. Attempting to harvest components from an active
corpse is usually problematic, so she makes the corpse more of, well, a corpse.

Kadoodles
---------

In this example, we see a psycho's assistant discussing the nature of the work
she does. Every component of a victim is potentially usable, and thus saleable.
The greatest psychos often purchase components rather than harvesting them all
(see [DeviCat](#devicat-3) above), and it is from such merchants as Doodles
that they seek the less... presentable components.

DeviCat
-------

Even psychos need step-by-step instructions sometimes. Fortunately, the Devi is
here with all the instructions you need. Reiko the Fauna demonstrates the first
steps towards success.

NightGalem
----------

Some people can get away with murder. Others need to conceal the evidence, at
least a little bit.

<https://clips.twitch.tv/TallInnocentKaleSuperVinlin>

CookingForNoobs
---------------

What do psychos contribute to society? Why, of course, they offer their stabby
services to those who are in need! Only a medical professional could talk of
surgery while gazing at food.

<https://clips.twitch.tv/DullAcceptableAlfalfaBIRB>

BjornsWorkshop
--------------

Never fight against the knife. Let it work for you. Interestingly, this
particular psycho feels that the face is a weird place to go to work, yet is
quite happy to discuss styles and techniques for working other parts of the
human body.

<https://clips.twitch.tv/RudeHorriblePistachioEleGiggle>

TambriArt
---------

Victim or minion? Either way, you don't need eyes if you're around this artist.
She will remove them and, perhaps, give you a replacement set. Or perhaps not.
They're overrated anyway.

CONCLUSION
----------

Actually, we haven't yet reached a true conclusion. The search for psychos is
[still ongoing](TwitchCreativePsycho) and we are likely to find more examples,
both of the same people we've already seen, and of additional psychos. But
already we can see ample evidence that creative persons have a strong tendency
to be psychotic murderers, at least when taken out of context. Support your
local [Twitch Creative](https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Creative) streamers
and help them to wear their straitjackets with pride and a sense of true
accomplishment. For after all, it takes many years of practice to become as
dangerous and awesome as these people are.
