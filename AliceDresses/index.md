Alice and her Dresses
=====================

[Alice Liddell](https://alice.fandom.com/wiki/Alice_Liddell) wears a different
[dress](https://alice.fandom.com/wiki/Dress) in each part of Wonderland that she
visits, and has some more as DLC. They're all awesome and they're all gorgeous
(well, okay, that might be a matter of opinion - Fleshmaiden says hi), and I've
commissioned a number of artists to create fanart of them. Those artists who
have granted permission for it have their work featured here. There is no
particular order to these and they do not in any way denote a ranking or
prioritization among the dresses, the artists, or anything of the sort. Enjoy
Alice's fashion show, and check out these talented artists!

The dress from the Mysterious East part of the world, as created by [Heartsome_NaNa](https://heartsomenanaart.weebly.com/).
Alice is carrying her iconic Vorpal Blade and is coming at us boldly across a
parchment of Chinese characters, some of which ÁÅ´ are aflame. Behind her,
elements of Chinese and Japanese design meet in a conglomeration formed by a
British view of the Orient, influenced more by what looks good on a mantle
than what's actually accurate.
