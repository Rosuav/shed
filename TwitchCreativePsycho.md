# Finding the Twitch Creative Psychos

Digital artist or psycho murderer? Can you even tell the difference?

It's well known that Twitch Creative has a lot of really amazing people. It's
an open secret that many of them are really psycho murderers (that is, they're
psychos, not that they murder psychos). Or at least, that would appear to be
the case, if quotes and clips are to be believed. Don't believe me? Check out
these prime examples:

* [Lara_cr](https://twitch.tv/lara_cr): https://clips.twitch.tv/CreativeEndearingWoodpeckerPipeHype

  - "I'm just going to borrow her face." (28-Jan-18)
  - "How tall can you make a giraffe before someone breaks its neck?" (09-Apr-18)
  - "We got a couple of minutes to kill you guys" (28-May-18) - psycho on a schedule

Don't worry; they're all safely behind the protective screens of Twitch. But
if you know of a streamer that fits this description, I want to know about them
(purely out of scientific curiosity, of course - I'm definitely not going to
lock them up in Rutledge Private Clinic and Asylum). In fact, I'm willing to
give a prize for the best evidence of psychosis. Please, send me clips!

The details:

* First prize will be $US 250. Additional prizes may be given out at the
  organizer's discretion, based on the number of submissions. Prize(s) will
  be sent via the streamer's tip jar or donation link. Fees and taxes are the
  responsibility of the recipient.
* Submissions should be [Twitch clips](https://help.twitch.tv/customer/en/portal/articles/2442508-how-to-use-clips)
  and must be created and submitted during the month of June 2018.
* The clip should be from a creative stream. If the stream category is not
  "Creative", it should be clear from the content of the clip that the stream
  is for the purpose of creating something. (For example, writing a game mod
  while in the category for that game counts as a creative stream.)
* Submit your clips via Twitter with the clip URL andany title or caption you
  need. Mention @rosuav, and use hashtag #TwitchCreativePsycho.
* Please don't artificially synthesize entries. Psychoses should come up
  naturally as part of the normal flow of conversation.
* Questions should be directed to @rosuav either on Twitter or Twitch.
* This is not affiliated with Twitch or Twitter or any other organization.
* I'm doing this to encourage Twitch Creative and to celebrate good humour.
  Don't make me regret doing it; participate in equally good humour. Have fun!
