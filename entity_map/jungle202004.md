Jungle's Apr 2020 update
========================

After the [Feb 2020 update](jungle202002), which was a highly significant
improvement to the map, things were stable for a while. The next notable
changes to the spawn locations came in April, bringing the map very close to
the spawn counts of the Valve maps.

* Previously, the current spawn point count means that there would
  be only ten "empty" spawn locations, compared to roughly two hundred on
  the other two maps; this means that you'd find loot very consistently. Now,
  there are enough spawns to have roughly one empty for every three items.
  This rewards heuristic spawn checking above pure luck-of-the-spawns,
  reducing the inconsistency from randomness and better rewarding skill,
  speed, and map knowledge. It now has 457 spawns, compared to 509 and 538 for
  the Valve-provided maps.
* Echo's label has been moved to a more useful location.
* There's a new spawn clump, presumably corresponding to the house added, but
  the radar doesn't show the house. They're between Echo and Bridge.
* As before, more spawns have been added towards the middle of the map. The
  edges still gained a few, but not as many. This will tend to force engagements
  a little more.
* There are still quite a few spawns that aren't really at named locations.
  Maybe too many?
* The radar still doesn't really line up perfectly, especially with parallax.
  Don't rely on the precise locations shown on this annotated map; for an index
  of refraction, see the rescue zones near Docks and Delta, and how the red
  highlight doesn't align with the checkered marker from the map itself.
