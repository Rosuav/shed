Jungle's Feb 2020 update
========================

Being a new map, dz_junglety has seen several updates since its inclusion. A
few highlights from the update released Feb 2020:

* Previously, there were insufficient spawn locations to generate all the loot.
  This resulted in the loose money simply not being spawned (100 wads of cash).
  As of Feb 2020, there are now just enough for the current loot mapping (343,
  with 333 items to be spawned). If Valve choose to add additional loot (even
  if it's not "normal" loot, such as the red barrels), or if a community server
  uses different loot distribution, this may break again; but for now, every
  item IS spawning. Note that the current spawn point count means that there
  will be only ten "empty" spawn locations, compared to roughly two hundred on
  the other two maps; this means that you'll find loot very consistently.
* A few labels have moved around near Radio, and its upper levels have been
  removed. It now more accurately portrays its true value.
* The label "Beta" has moved northward. This eliminates the weird no-man's-land
  with as good spawns as a named location, giving credit to Beta.
* Most locations have gained at least 1-3 additional spawns. A few smaller
  ones haven't, but they haven't lost any either.
* The biggest spawn gains have been in the interior of the island. This should
  tend to cause players to clump, creating interesting encounters.
* The perimeter of the island gained the fewest spawns, but even there, most of
  the named locations have gained 1-3 spawn points.
