Calling the ButtSquad! This is your ButtSignal!

[DeviCat](https://twitch.tv/devicat) is doing the responsible financial thing and not
spending money on anything she doesn't absolutely need to. But that creates the sad
situation that she can't support other streamers, even when she has been supporting
them for a year or more. Since Twitch subs completely reset their streaks if you miss
them for a month, that means she will lose all of that loveliness.

But we can do something about it. Check these links periodically, and make sure they
all say that a gift subscription is not available (because that means she currently
has an active sub). With teamwork, we can make sure she remains subscribed.

The dates given are approximately when the subs will recur. If a few people check back every week
or thereabouts, she'll never lose a sub streak. We can do this!
