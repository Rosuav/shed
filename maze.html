<h1>Maze Generator</h1>
<p>Back in the dim dark history of the 20th century, I had a really old BASIC program that generated mazes. I never
understood the algorithm it used, and the code was pretty opaque, but it did generate beautiful mazes. This is my
tribute to that old program, an attempt to carry its inspiration into the modern day - and a web browser.</p>
