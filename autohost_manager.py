TODO Mon?: Autohost manager for AliCatFiberarts (and others).
* Have a list of high priority streams, in order (or with priorities)
* Listen for, or poll for, streams going live
* If (a) a high priority stream has just gone live, and (b) you are currently hosting, and (c) the hosted stream has lower priority
* Then send "/unhost" to the channel.
* Have a very very simple GUI (tkinter?)
* "Optional: Rename this to autohost_manager.pyw to hide the black box"
