<h1>2D Logic Minesweeper</h1>
<details><summary>What, why, and all those other questions?</summary>
<p>2D Logic Minesweeper is a minesweeper game that guarantees that the game can
be solved with pure logic. You will NEVER have to guess. It was inspired by a
very old game called "3D Logic Minesweeper", originally on OS/2. This does not
have the three-dimensional aspects of that game, but it does have many of the
other features.</p>
<p>Note that, as per the original 3D game, flagging something that isn't a mine
is as much a failure as digging a mine is. You will die. :)</p>

<ul>
<li>Get a flag for mines, not just an asterisk</li>
<li>Get a BOOM for digging a mine</li>
<li>Get a bad-flag for flagging a non-mine</li>
<li>Click (or right-click) on exposed cell to highlight region and say "X of Y unknowns are mines" per OS/2 impl</li>
<li>Generate games in background and save to LocalStorage</li>
<li>Maybe go 3D?????</li>
<li>Get better docs</li>
