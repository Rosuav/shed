<p>2D Logic Minesweeper is a minesweeper game that guarantees that the game can
be solved with pure logic. You will NEVER have to guess. It was inspired by a
very old game called "3D Logic Minesweeper", originally on OS/2. This does not
have the three-dimensional aspects of that game, but it does have many of the
other features.</p>
