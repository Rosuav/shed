Games sorted by how well they welcome modding
=============================================

The Good (Welcoming)
--------------------

These games openly welcome third party mods. They may offer event hooks or
other facilities, or maybe even have a first-party mod manager that helps you
enable and disable them.

The Okay (Ignoring)
-------------------

While not specifically *welcoming* modders, these games do at least permit it.
They might simply ignore what you're doing, with no documentation or assistance
in figuring out what anything means.

The Bad (Hostile)
-----------------

Some games are openly hostile towards modding. All you can do is edit your save
files and hope for the best. The vanilla experience is the only one the devs
have considered. Attempting to modify the game may see you branded as a cheater
(or worse), even if you're trying to run your own modded game among friends.
