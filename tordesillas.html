<h1>Finding Saint Tordesillas</h1>
<p>In 1494, the Treaty of Tordesillas was organized by the Pope to draw a separation between Castilian (Spanish) and
Portuguese claims in the New World. Evidence of this can still be seen, as a large number of cities and towns have been
named in honour of various saints - but these names reflect the languages predominant in these areas. For example,
"San Antonio" (Saint Anthony) is Spanish, but "São José" (Saint Joseph) is Portuguese. We shall attempt to illustrate
this distinction by placing map markers for every known city with a saint name.
