Questions will be gathered here for a future stream advice stream.

* (TODO: Check if SLOBS can use OBS-WebSocket (Win7 VM) or has its own RC)
* Moderation tools and how/when to use each one:
  - Automod
  - some of the famous mod bots incl Nightbot
  - human mods
  - follower-only mode
  - sub-only mode
  - slow mode
  - emote-only mode, although that's usually a toy
  - chat delay (don't normally bother)
* Tips on doing dual streams
  - don't bother trying to host the other person's video - just link to kadgar
  - set up Discord: have two channels, one public and one that you're in
  - make sure you're sharing microphone correctly
  - no need to have the other person's stream up, but if you do, mute it
  - keep an eye on both people's chats
  - have a bot command in your title to link to kadgar
* TODO: Build up a set of documents with tips for streamers at different levels
  - The absolute minimum you need to know in order to stream
    - this will be extremely short
  - Level up your stream
  - AffiliateCongrats
  - Raiding
  - View counts and the difference between affiliate pushes and partner pushes
