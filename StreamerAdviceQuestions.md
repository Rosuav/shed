Mirror suggested that I could do a "Streamer Advice" stream where I answer
questions or give advice about streaming tech stuff.

* *Mirror:* Please include information about how OBS remote works, since you
  said that can be a potential work around if a streamer forgets to end their
  streaming software.
* (TODO: Check if SLOBS can use OBS-WebSocket (Win7 VM) or has its own RC)
* Discuss possible stream bot: automatically stop stream when you start hosting
  (a sort of molly-guard)
* Backing up your OBS configs esp using git
* *Mirror:* What exactly are view bots, why are they in my channel, & what
  should I do about them? For instance, should I ignore them, restrict them
  from earning currency, or just ban them outright.
* *Mirror:* Things to consider when choosing channel bots or extensions, privacy
  granting issues, channel support personal & privileges they can be granted.
* General tips: install Python 3, use git, have my shed
* OBS features: Studio Mode, bandwidth test (show example, don't demo), Stats
  window (View|Stats), locking scene elements, source group, scenes as sources,
  Ctrl-F to Fill space
* Streaming tools: Mustard Mine, StilleBot
* Multiple monitors and how to make the most of them
* Stream Deck, StreamPuppy, OBS Remote Control
* Music selections and VOD muting
