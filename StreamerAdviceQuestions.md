Mirror suggested that I could do a "Streamer Advice" stream where I answer
questions or give advice about streaming tech stuff.

* *Mirror:* Please include information about how OBS remote works, since you
  said that can be a potential work around if a streamer forgets to end their
  streaming software.
* (TODO: Check if SLOBS can use OBS-WebSocket (Win7 VM) or has its own RC)
* Discuss possible stream bot: automatically stop stream when you start hosting
  (a sort of molly-guard)
