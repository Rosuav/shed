//The default mouse-2 action is "+attack2", but the ZOOM action is mostly better.

//So switching to +zoom (IN_ZOOM) removes the ability to easily select burst mode
//(meh), removes the misfeature of removing suppressors (yay), and otherwise
//doesn't break anything. Note that you can't just run "attack2" in the console;
//and "+attack2; -attack2" doesn't work either (you have to be *in* the attack2
//state for a tick). So making burst mode available means binding something to
//+attack2, which you can then hit.
