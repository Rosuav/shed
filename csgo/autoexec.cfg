//So switching to +zoom (IN_ZOOM) removes the ability to easily select burst mode
//(meh), removes the misfeature of removing suppressors (yay), and the only real
//loss is lobbing grenades (short-range throw). Note that you can't just run
//"attack2" in the console; and "+attack2; -attack2" doesn't work either (you have
//to be *in* the attack2 state for a tick). So making lob and burst mode available
//means binding something to +attack2, which you can then hit.
//Meh. It also destroys player cycling while spectating. Reverting this change.
