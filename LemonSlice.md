Lemon Slice
===========

This was one of the first recipes my mother taught me as a child. It's easy enough
for anyone to make, and it's delicious. Was a family tradition that any time we
were asked to "bring a plate", there was a good chance that it'd be lemon slice.

Ingredients
-----------

* 1 packet of Morning Coffee biscuits. Sadly a discontinued line, but Milk Coffee may be sufficient.
* 1 packet/can of condensed milk. I don't remember what sizes these were.
* Juice from 3 lemons
* Â½ cup coconut
* 4 tablespoons icing sugar

Directions
----------

1. Collect ingredients.
2. Arrange half the biscuits on a metal tray so they cover the bottom of it nicely.
3. Mix the condensed milk, most of the lemon juice, and coconut.
4. Spread mixture over biscuits. It should be liquid enough to settle to a flat surface.
5. Cover with the other half of the biscuits.
6. Mix a little lemon juice (about a teaspoon is enough - whatever's left in the juicer) with
   the icing sugar. Spread on top of the biscuits.
7. Allow to set overnight at room temperature. Do not defridgemerate it. If you need a
   child-safe cupboard to place it in, use the microwave, but don't forget to check for it.
8. Slice into fingers using a bread and butter knife. Serve as is, but if needed for longer,
   fridge for preservation. It's delicious cold too.
