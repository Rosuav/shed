How to raid on Twitch
=====================

Raiding is a great way to share the love with other streamers, to meet new
friends, to carry the hype to another channel, and So Much Moreâ„¢. To help with
the various steps required to make everything work smoothly, here's a quick
checklist or step-by-step to out.

1. Select a raid target. Are you raiding an old friend? Raiding someone you
   just found because they're in a notable category? Returning the favour to
   someone who's raided you in the past?
2. Snoop your target. (Make sure you're not accidentally revealing too much
   of that person's stream; be sure to mute the stream so you don't rebroadcast
   their audio by mistake.) Try to figure out whether they're about to end, or
   go on break. It's most fun to raid someone who is actually there to receive.
3. In your chat, type "/raid targetname" (eg "/raid devicat"), without the
   quotes. Alternatively, in your Twitch dashboard, go to the "Raid and Host"
   section, type in the channel name, and click Raid.
4. Do you have a raid call? Encourage your community to synchronize on some
   message that reflects your channel's theme or style. The clipboard is your
   friend here, as is a channel bot command like "!raid" to suggest some
   text to your viewers.
5. Say your goodbyes and thank-yous, your closer, etc.
6. Go to a closing screen for the last 10-15 seconds of the raid. Depending on
   how much Twitch lag people are on, they won't see or hear you for the last
   little bit.
7. Click "Raid Now" to bring everyone over! Since you had the target's stream
   open from step 2, you're there too (and you're past any preroll ads that
   might play).
8. IMPORTANT: Stop your streaming software from broadcasting. This is not an
   automatic part of the /raid command.
9. Unmute the stream you're visiting, and have all the fun!

It sounds complicated, but it feels a lot smoother when you're actually doing
it. I cannot recommend raiding highly enough, as it's a great way for people
to find new friends (your community meets the person you're raiding, and your
target's community meets you!), and sharing the love only strengthens it!
